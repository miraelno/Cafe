When a letter arrives for unhappy but 
ordinary Harry Potter, a decade-old secret 
is revealed to him. His parents were 
wizards, killed by a Dark Lord’s curse 
when Harry was just a baby, and which he 
somehow survived. Escaping from his 
unbearable Muggle guardians to Hogwarts, 
a wizarding school brimming with ghosts 
and enchantments, Harry stumbles into a 
sinister adventure when he finds a three¬ 
headed dog guarding a room on the third 
floor. Then he hears of a missing stone 
with astonishing powers which could be 
valuable, dangerous, or both. 

‘Funny, imaginative, magical... Rowling has 
woken up a whole generation to reading. In 
the 2020s, thirty-something book-lovers 
will know each other by smug references 
to Diagon Alley and Quidditch’ The Times 

‘This is a terrific book’ Sunday Telegraph 

‘Has all the makings of a classic ... Rowling 
uses classic narrative devices with flair and 
originality and delivers a complex and 
demanding plot in the form of a hugely 
entertaining thriller’ Scotsman 

‘And you thought wizardry was for 
children. Harry Potter will make you think 
again. He casts his spells on grown¬ 
ups too’ James Naughtie 

‘Full of surprises and jokes; comparisons 
with Dahl are, this time, justified’
